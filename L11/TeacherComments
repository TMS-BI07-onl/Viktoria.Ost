Well done!

Your answer is correct!
I would suggest to use IS NOT NULL filter, not !='', it's not really professional. :)

What was the reason to have маршруты outside of CTE?
I'm not really getting the point of having count(Рейсы.[id рейса]) = 0. Why so?
Queries with no CTE are easier to understand. At least, for me personally.

I think that subquery with top1 won't return expected result, because it already got 1 row before joining by passenger id. So, the join result will be NULL.

I'm pretty sure that your idea with Поездки.[id пассажира]=п.[id пассажира] will not work as you desired. This part of query has only one connection to поездки and doesn't see any connection from major query 'from' clause.
